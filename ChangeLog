* Tue Dec 11 2012 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge dot net> 1.00.0

* Sun Dec 18 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge dot net> 0.2.3
- Two new criteria have been added to the fare rule and to the booking
request.
- The CMake build system now accepts independent unit tests (not dependent on
the core module being built). That allows, for instance, to benchmark the
project with third-party libraries.

* Mon Dec 12 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge.net> 0.2.2
- Took into account feedback from the review request (#728815). The test/math/
sub-directory has been moved out into a dedicated GitHub repository
(https://github.com/denisarnaud/playground). The other tests (sequential
generation) are now checked.

* Mon Dec 05 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge.net> 0.2.1
- [Dev] Adapted the database-related source code to the new SOCI-3.1 API.
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework. For instance, the package
versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components, as
well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries (only
when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.
		
* Sun Aug 07 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge.net> 0.1.0
- First release. The demand rule sets are parsed either from a CSV file or
from a built-in sample BOM tree. Then, TraDemGen generates booking requests
according to the given rule sets.
