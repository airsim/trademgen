A short list of the main features of TraDemgEn is given below sorted
in different categories. Many more features and functions exist and
for these we refer to the reference documentation.

\section ft_demand_generation Demand generation

The demand can be generated thanks to two relatively advanced pieces
of algorithm, both following a sequential principle. That is, the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)">events</a>
(booking requests) are generated one after the other, sequentially,
rather than being generated all at once at the beginning of the
process (e.g., a simulation).

The two sequential methods are:
- 'Intuitive' method. The booking period is sliced in <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)">intervals</a>,
  where the arrival rate of events (booking requests) is known for
  each of those intervals, say \f$\lambda_i\f$. The inter-arrival
  process then follows an <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential
  law</a>. That is, the final number of booking requests follows a <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homogeneous_Poisson_process">Non
  homogeneous Poisson distribution</a>. With that method, the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a> of that <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">distribution</a>
  is therefore equal to the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">mean</a>.
- 'Advanced' method. The process uses <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order
  statistics</a> in order to mimic the behaviour of <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)">uniform
  distributions</a> projected onto the know arrival pattern of
  events. With that method, the final number of booking requests is
  first drawn, following any probability distribution (e.g., <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">Gamma</a>,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta</a> or
  even Weibull law) with any required standard deviation. Then, each
  booking request is drawn in sequence:
 - according to a mere <a
   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)">uniform
   distribution</a>,
 - and projected onto the known booking arrival pattern.
