\section intro Introduction

There are two convenient methods of linking your
programs with the TraDemGen library. The first one employs the \c
`pkg-config' command (see <a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/">
http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/</a>), whereas the second one uses \c
`trademgen-config' script. These methods are shortly described below.


\section pkgconfig Using the pkg-config command

\c `pkg-config' is a helper tool used when compiling applications and
libraries. It helps you insert the correct compiler and linker
options. The syntax of the \c `pkg-config' is as follows:

\code
pkg-config <options> <library_name>  
\endcode

For instance, assuming that you need to compile an TraDemGen based program
<tt>`my_prog.cpp'</tt>, you should use the following command:

\code
g++ `pkg-config --cflags trademgen` -o my_prog my_prog.cpp `pkg-config --libs trademgen`
\endcode  

For more information see the \c `pkg-config' man pages.


\section trademgen_config Using the trademgen-config script

TraDemGen provides a shell script called \c `trademgen-config`, which is
installed by default in \c `$prefix/bin'
(\c `/usr/local/bin') directory. It can be used to simplify
compilation and linking of TraDemGen based programs. The usage of this
script is quite similar to the usage of the \c `pkg-config' command.

Assuming that you need to compile the program \c `my_prog.cpp'
you can now do that with the following command:

\code
g++ `trademgen-config --cflags` -o my_prog_opt my_prog.cpp `trademgen-config --libs`
\endcode

A list of \c `trademgen-config' options can be obtained by typing:

\code
trademgen-config --help
\endcode

If the \c `trademgen-config' command is not found by your shell, you should add
its location \c `$prefix/bin' to the \c PATH environment variable, e.g.:

\code
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
\endcode


\section autotools M4 macro for the GNU Autotools

A M4 macro file is delivered with TraDemGen, namely `trademgen.m4', which
can be found in, e.g., `/usr/share/aclocal'. When used by a
`configure' script, thanks to he <tt>`AM_PATH_TraDemGen'</tt> macro
(specified in the M4 macro file), the following Makefile variables are
then defined:
- <tt>`TraDemGen_VERSION'</tt> (e.g., defined to 0.23.0)
- <tt>`TraDemGen_CFLAGS'</tt> (e.g., defined to <tt>`-I${prefix}/include'</tt>)
- <tt>`TraDemGen_LIBS'</tt> (e.g., defined to <tt>`-L${prefix}/lib -ltrademgen'</tt>)


\section dynamiclinking Using TraDemGen with dynamic linking

When using static linking some of the library routines in TraDemGen are
copied into your executable program. This can lead to unnecessary
large executables. To avoid having too large executable files you may
use dynamic linking instead. Dynamic linking means that the actual
linking is performed when the program is executed. This requires that
the system is able to locate the shared TraDemGen library file during your
program execution. If you install the TraDemGen library using a non-standard
prefix, the \c `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable might be used to
inform the linker of the dynamic library location, e.g.:
\code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<TraDemGen installation prefix>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\endcode
