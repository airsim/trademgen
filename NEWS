* 2011-12-12:
- Version 0.2.2
- Took into account feedback from the review request (#728815). The test/math/
  sub-directory has been moved out into a dedicated GitHub repository
  (https://github.com/denisarnaud/playground). The other tests (sequential
  generation) are now checked.

* 2011-12-05:
- Version 0.2.1
- [Dev] Adapted the database-related source code to the new SOCI-3.1 API.
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework. For instance, the package
  versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components,
  as well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
  rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries
  (only when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.

* 2011-08-07:
- Version 0.1.0
- First release. The demand rule sets are parsed either from a CSV file 
  or from a built-in sample BOM tree. Then, TraDemGen generates booking
  requests according to the given rule sets.
