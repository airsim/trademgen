* 2020-05-30:
- Version 1.00.6
- Removed dependency on Python

* 2019-11-11:
- Version 1.00.5
- CMake helper files for newer versions of Boost

* 2019-07-11:
- Version 1.00.4
- CMake support files updated for Python 3.8

* 2019-01-15:
- Version 1.00.3
- CMake nows finds out automatically the right Boost.Python library version
- Python 3.4 is the new minimum required version

* 2015-06-27:
- Version 1.00.2
- Moved the Python utilities into standard directories

* 2015-06-14:
- Version 1.00.1
- The CMake helper files are now aligned with those of StdAir.

* 2012-12-11:
- Open source release.
- [Dev] Events no longer stored in the StdAir BOM root: new module SEvMgr
  handling events through an event queue.
- [Dev] Services dedicated to JSON export of events.
- [Build] Test coverage option with gcov.

* 2011-12-18:
- Version 0.2.3
- Two new criteria have been added to the fare rule and to the booking request.
- The CMake build system now accepts independent unit tests (not dependent on
  the core module being built). That allows, for instance, to benchmark the
  project with third-party libraries.

* 2011-12-12:
- Version 0.2.2
- Took into account feedback from the review request (#728815). The test/math/
  sub-directory has been moved out into a dedicated GitHub repository
  (https://github.com/denisarnaud/playground). The other tests (sequential
  generation) are now checked.

* 2011-12-05:
- Version 0.2.1
- [Dev] Adapted the database-related source code to the new SOCI-3.1 API.
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework. For instance, the package
  versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components,
  as well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
  rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries
  (only when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.

* 2011-08-07:
- Version 0.1.0
- First release. The demand rule sets are parsed either from a CSV file 
  or from a built-in sample BOM tree. Then, TraDemGen generates booking
  requests according to the given rule sets.
