	  C++ Simulated Travel Demand Generation Library

\section sec_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <trademgen/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

TraDemGen aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, able to generate demand for travel solutions (e.g.,
from JFK to PEK on 25-05-2009) according to characteristics (e.g.,
Willingness-To-Pay, preferred airline, etc).

TraDemGen makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the Boost
(C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The library covers the following areas:
- Generation of booking requests from demand rule sets
- Demand rule sets: storage, engine, management
